## LSTM Autoencoder for anomaly detection/outlier plotting 
#### This repository contains two main parts: 
1. one with the code to train and evaluate a lstm model (lstm.ipynb), and 
2. one where the model is implemented in a Plotly FigureWidget Scatter plot (testing_notebook.ipynb).

#### The code in lstm.ipynb comes from https://github.com/curiousily/Deep-Learning-For-Hackers/blob/master/14.time-series-anomaly-detection.ipynb
#### The FigureWidget Scatter plot is an interactive plot where you can select data points to manually mark them as outliers or non-outliers.
