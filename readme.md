## LSTM Autoencoder for anomaly detection/outlier plotting 
#### This repository consists of two main parts: 
1. lstm.ipynb: This notebook contains the code for training and evaluating an LSTM model. It utilizes the code provided in the following repository: https://github.com/curiousily/Deep-Learning-For-Hackers/blob/master/14.time-series-anomaly-detection.ipynb. The LSTM model is designed for anomaly detection in time series data.
2. testing_notebook.ipynb: In this notebook, the trained LSTM model is implemented within a Plotly FigureWidget Scatter plot. The Scatter plot is interactive, allowing you to select data points and manually classify them as outliers or non-outliers. This feature provides a convenient way to visualize and analyze the anomalies detected by the LSTM model.

By combining the LSTM autoencoder for anomaly detection with the interactive capabilities of the Plotly FigureWidget Scatter plot, this repository offers a comprehensive solution for detecting and analyzing outliers in time series data.
